# Spectral-and-K-means-clustering-of-patients-with-MDD

Here I cluster patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder using both traditional (K-means) and modern (Spectral Clustering) clustering algorithms. I then assess the clinical utility of these clusters by assessing whether these clusters enable improved prediction of treatment outcome with specific antidepressants (nortryptaline and escitalopram).
